    <p>Welcome to the North Dakotans for Privacy website! We are a group of citizens concerned about our privacy rights in the digital age. This website is a resource for information and advocacy on privacy issues.</p>
    <p>We are an organization created by North Dakotans in order to teach other North Dakotans why they should value their privacy and why they should protect their privacy.</p>

<p>We also aim to help connect North Dakotans to those who can impact their privacy, such as legislators and business leaders.</p>
    
    <p>Here, you will find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information about your privacy rights in North Dakota</li>
      <li>Tips on how to protect your privacy online and offline</li>
      <li>Ways to get involved in the fight for privacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We believe that everyone has the right to control their personal information. Together, we can work to create a more privacy-protective world.</p>
